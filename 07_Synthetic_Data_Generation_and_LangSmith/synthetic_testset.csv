"How significant is the usage of ChatGPT, with 18 billion messages sent weekly by 700 million users, in terms of its global adoption?","['Introduction ChatGPT launched in November 2022. By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population.1 For a new technology, this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024). This paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the largest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3 The sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported adoption of LLMs (Bick et al., 2024; Pew Research Center, 2025); however there are reasons to expect bias in self-reports (Ling and Imas, 2025), and none of these papers have been able to directly track the quantity or nature of chatbot conversations. Two recent papers do report statistics on chatbot conversations, classified in a variety of ways (Handa et al., 2025; Tomlinson et al., 2025). We build on this work in several respects. First, the pool of users on ChatGPT is far larger, meaning we expect our data to be a closer approximation to the average chatbot user.4 Second, we use automated classifiers to report on the types of messages that users send using new classification taxonomies relative to the existing literature. Third, we report the diffusion of chatbot use across populations and the growth of different types of usage within cohorts. Fourth, we use a secure data clean room protocol to analyze aggregated employment and education categories for a sample of our users, lending new insights about differences in the types of messages sent by different groups while protecting user privacy. Our primary sample is a random selection of messages sent to ChatGPT on consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro) between May 2024 and June 2025.5 Messages from the user to chatbot are classified automatically using a number of different taxonomies: whether the message is used for paid work, the topic of conversation, and the type of interaction (asking, doing, or expressing), and the O*NET task the user is performing. Each taxonomy is defined in a prompt passed to an LLM, allowing us to classify messages without any human seeing them. We give the text of most prompts in Appendix A along with details about how the prompts were validated in Appendix B.6 The classification pipeline is protected by a series of privacy measures, detailed below, to ensure no leakage of sensitive information during the automated analysis. In a secure data clean room, we relate taxonomies of messages to aggregated employment and education categories. Table 1 shows the growth in total message volume for work and non-work usage. Both types of 1Reuters (2025), Roth (2025) 2Bick et al. (2024) report that 28% of US adults used ChatGPT in late 2024, higher than any other chatbot. 3We use the term LLM loosely here and give more details in the following section. 4Wiggers (2025) reports estimates that in April 2025 ChatGPT was receiving more than 10 times as many visitors as either Claude or Copilot. 5Our sample includes the three consumer plans (Free, Plus, or Pro). OpenAI also offers a variety of other ChatGPT plans (Business fka. Teams, Enterprise, Education), which we do not include in our sample. 6Our classifiers take into account not just the randomly-selected user message, but also a portion of the preceding messages in that conversation. 1']","By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population.

What is Claude in the context of ChatGPT usage?,"['Table 1: ChatGPT daily message counts (millions), broken down by likely work-related or non-work-related. Total daily counts are exact measurements of message volume from all consumer plans. Daily counts of work and non-work related messages are estimated by classifying a random sample of conversations from that day. Sampling is done to exclude users who opt-out of sharing their messages for model training, users who self- report their age as under 18, logged-out users, deleted conversations, and accounts which have been deactivated or banned (details available in Section 3). Reported values are 7-day averages (to smooth weekly fluctuation) ending on the 26th of June 2024 and 26th of June 2025. messages have grown continuously, but non-work messages have grown faster and now represent more than 70% of all consumer ChatGPT messages. While most economic analysis of AI has focused on its impact on productivity in paid work, the impact on activity outside of work (home production) is on a similar scale and possibly larger. The decrease in the share of work-related messages is primarily due to changing usage within each cohort of users rather than a change in the composition of new ChatGPT users. This finding is consistent with Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025), who use choice experiments to uncover willingness-to-pay for generative AI and estimate a consumer surplus of at least $97 billion in 2024 alone in the US. We next report on a classification of messages using a taxonomy developed at OpenAI for un- derstanding product usage (“conversation classifier”). Nearly 80% of all ChatGPT usage falls into three broad categories, which we call Practical Guidance, Seeking Information, and Writing. Practical Guidance is the most common use case and includes activities like tutoring and teaching, how-to advice about a variety of topics, and creative ideation.7 Seeking Information includes searching for information about people, current events, products, and recipes, and appears to be a very close sub- stitute for web search. Writing includes the automated production of emails, documents and other communications, but also editing, critiquing, summarizing, and translating text provided by the user. Writing is the most common use case at work, accounting for 40% of work-related messages on average in June 2025. About two-thirds of all Writing messages ask ChatGPT to modify user text (editing, critiquing, translating, etc.) rather than creating new text from scratch. About 10% of all messages are requests for tutoring or teaching, suggesting that education is a key use case for ChatGPT. Two of our findings stand in contrast to other work. First, we find the share of messages related to computer coding is relatively small: only 4.2% of ChatGPT messages are related to computer programming, compared to 33% of work-related Claude conversations Handa et al. (2025).8 Second, we find the share of messages related to companionship or social-emotional issues is fairly small: only 1.9% of ChatGPT messages are on the topic of Relationships and Personal Reflection and 0.4% are related 7The difference between Practical Guidance and Seeking Information is that the former is highly customized to the user and can be adapted based on conversation and follow-up, whereas the latter is factual information that should be the same for all users. For example, users interested in running might ask ChatGPT for the Boston Marathon qualifying times by age and gender (Seeking Information), or they might ask for a customized workout plan that matches their goals and current level of fitness (Practical Guidance). 8Handa et al. (2025) report that 37% of conversations are mapped to a “computer and mathematical” occupation category, and their Figure 12 shows 30% or more of all imputed tasks are programming or IT-related. We believe the discrepancy is partly due to the difference in types of users between Claude and ChatGPT, additionally Handa et al. (2025) only includes queries that ”possibly involve an occupational task”. 2']","Claude is mentioned as a term in the context of ChatGPT usage, but the provided information does not specify what Claude is or how it relates to ChatGPT.

ChatGPT use in jobs?,"['Variation by Occupation Figure 23 presents variation in ChatGPT usage by user occupation. Due to privacy-preserving aggre- gation limits, we report results for the following broad occupation categories – (1) all nonprofessional occupations, including administrative, clerical, service, and blue-collar occupations; (2) computer- related occupations; (3) engineering and science occupations; (4) management and business occupa- tions; and (5) all other professional occupations, including law, education, and health care.26 As above, the left-hand side of the figure shows unadjusted comparisons and the right-hand side presents the coefficients on each occupation category from a regression of message shares on age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, education, occupation categories, job seniority, firm size, and industry. Users in highly paid professional and technical occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work.27 Panel A shows that the unadjusted work shares are 57% for computer-related occupations; 50% for management and business; 48% for engineering and science; 44% for other professional oc- cupations; and only 40% for all non-professional occupations. Regression adjustment moves these figures around slightly, but the gaps by occupation remain highly statistically significant. Users in highly-paid professional occupations are more likely to send work-related messages. Because work usage is so different by occupation, we restrict the sample only to work-related messages in Panels B and C. Panel B presents the share of work-related messages that are Asking messages, by occupation. We find that users in highly paid professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for Asking rather than Doing.28 This is especially true in scientific and technical occupations. 47% of the work-related messages sent by users employed in computer-related occupa- tions are Asking messages, compared to only 32% for non-professional occupations. These differences shrink somewhat with regression adjustment, but remain highly statistically significant. Panel C presents results by conversation topic. Writing is especially common for users employed in management and business occupations, accounting for 52% of all work-related messages. Writing is also relatively common in non-professional and other professional occupations like education and health care, accounting for 50% and 49% of work-related messages respectively. Technical Help consti- tutes 37% of all work-related messages for users employed in computer-related occupations, compared to 16% in engineering and science and only about 8% for all other categories. Regression adjustment affects gaps by occupation only modestly. Overall there are stark differences in the distribution of conversation topics by user occupation, with work-related messages clearly focused on the core tasks in each job (e.g. Writing for management and business, Technical Help for technical occupations). We also present data on the most common Generalized Work Activities (GWAs) associated with each broad occupation group, as measured by 2-digit Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) codes. Table 24 presents the frequency ranking of work-related messages in each SOC code of the seven most common GWAs.29 26Management and business are SOC2 codes 11 and 13. Computer-related is SOC2 code 15. Engineering and Science are SOC2 codes 17 and 19. Other Professional are SOC2 codes 21 to 29. Nonprofessional occupations are SOC codes 31 to 53. 27As discussed in Section: Data and Privacy, our dataset only includes users on ChatGPT Consumer plans. Corporate users may also use ChatGPT Business (formerly known as Teams) or ChatGPT Enterprise. 28Very few work-related messages are classified as Expressing. 29Appendix D contains a full report of GWA counts broken down by occupation, for both work-related ChatGPT 31']","Variation by Occupation Figure 23 shows variation in ChatGPT usage by user occupation, with different occupation categories like nonprofessional, computer-related, engineering and science, management and business, and other professional occupations.

What does Seeking Information mean in ChatGPT usage?,"['Conclusion This paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025, ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop- tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new technology is used and who is using it. This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans during any part of the work on this paper. This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70% of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster. Second, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics are Practical Guidance, Writing, and Seeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages. Computer Pro- gramming and Relationships and Personal Reflection account for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages respectively. Third, Writing is by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages overall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About two-thirds of Writing messages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text from scratch. Fourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing. About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance, advice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process (Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing). Asking messages have grown faster than Doing messages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that measures user satisfaction and direct user feedback. Fifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025, more than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages sent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially fast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly educated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related messages and for Asking rather than Doing messages at work. Overall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy. The fact that non-work usage is increasing faster suggests that the welfare gains from generative AI usage could be substantial. Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025) estimate that US users would have to be paid $98 to forgo using generative AI for a month, implying a surplus of at least $97 billion a year. Within work usage, we find that users currently appear to derive value from using ChatGPT as an advisor or research assistant, not just a technology that performs job tasks directly. Still, ChatGPT likely improves worker output by providing decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs where productivity is increasing in the quality of decision-making. 36']","Seeking Information is one of the three most common conversation topics in ChatGPT, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages.

"Considering the rapid growth of ChatGPT usage by July 2025, as detailed in the first segment, and the specific increase in non-work-related queries during the same period highlighted in the second segment, how has the prevalence of non-work-related ChatGPT messages evolved by July 2025, and what does this suggest about the broader impact of ChatGPT on user activities beyond professional tasks?","['<1-hop>\n\nIntroduction ChatGPT launched in November 2022. By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population.1 For a new technology, this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024). This paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the largest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3 The sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported adoption of LLMs (Bick et al., 2024; Pew Research Center, 2025); however there are reasons to expect bias in self-reports (Ling and Imas, 2025), and none of these papers have been able to directly track the quantity or nature of chatbot conversations. Two recent papers do report statistics on chatbot conversations, classified in a variety of ways (Handa et al., 2025; Tomlinson et al., 2025). We build on this work in several respects. First, the pool of users on ChatGPT is far larger, meaning we expect our data to be a closer approximation to the average chatbot user.4 Second, we use automated classifiers to report on the types of messages that users send using new classification taxonomies relative to the existing literature. Third, we report the diffusion of chatbot use across populations and the growth of different types of usage within cohorts. Fourth, we use a secure data clean room protocol to analyze aggregated employment and education categories for a sample of our users, lending new insights about differences in the types of messages sent by different groups while protecting user privacy. Our primary sample is a random selection of messages sent to ChatGPT on consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro) between May 2024 and June 2025.5 Messages from the user to chatbot are classified automatically using a number of different taxonomies: whether the message is used for paid work, the topic of conversation, and the type of interaction (asking, doing, or expressing), and the O*NET task the user is performing. Each taxonomy is defined in a prompt passed to an LLM, allowing us to classify messages without any human seeing them. We give the text of most prompts in Appendix A along with details about how the prompts were validated in Appendix B.6 The classification pipeline is protected by a series of privacy measures, detailed below, to ensure no leakage of sensitive information during the automated analysis. In a secure data clean room, we relate taxonomies of messages to aggregated employment and education categories. Table 1 shows the growth in total message volume for work and non-work usage. Both types of 1Reuters (2025), Roth (2025) 2Bick et al.

By July 2025, ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop- tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new technology is used and who is using it. This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology. No user messages were observed by humans during any part of the work on this paper. This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70% of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster. Second, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics are Practical Guidance, Writing, and Seeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages. Computer Pro- gramming and Relationships and Personal Reflection account for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages respectively. Third, Writing is by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages overall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About two-thirds of Writing messages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text from scratch. Fourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing. About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance, advice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process (Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing). Asking messages have grown faster than Doing messages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that measures user satisfaction and direct user feedback. Fifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025, more than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages sent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially fast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly educated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related messages and for Asking rather than Doing messages at work. Overall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy. The fact that non-work usage is increasing faster suggests that the welfare gains from generative AI usage could be substantial. Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025) estimate that US users would have to be paid $98 to forgo using generative AI for a month, implying a surplus of at least $97 billion a year. Within work usage, we find that users currently appear to derive value from using ChatGPT as an advisor or research assistant, not just a technology that performs job tasks directly. Still, ChatGPT likely improves worker output by providing decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs where productivity is increasing in the quality of decision-making. 36']","By July 2025, approximately 70% of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work, with both work-related and non-work-related queries increasing over time. Notably, non-work queries have been increasing at a faster rate than work-related ones. This trend indicates that ChatGPT's usage has expanded beyond professional tasks, reflecting a broader impact on users' personal activities, information seeking, and practical guidance. The significant rise in non-work messages suggests that ChatGPT is becoming an integral part of daily life, supporting a wide range of activities that enhance overall user welfare and demonstrate its influence beyond the workplace.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
