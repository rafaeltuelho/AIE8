# Build 🏗️

In today's assignment, we'll be creating Together AI endpoints, and then building an Agentic RAG application.

- 🤝 Breakout Room #1
    - Set-up Open Source Endpoint (Instructions [here](./ENDPOINT_SETUP.md)) ((This process may take 15-20min.))
    - Test Endpoint and Embeddings with the `endpoint_slammer.ipynb` notebook.

- 🤝 Breakout Room #2
    - Use the Open Source Endpoints to build an Agentic RAG LangGraph application (use Session 14/15 code to get started)

       > NOTE: You should look toward: [ChatTogether](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/together/), and [TogetherEmbeddings](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/text_embedding/together/) for help on how to build these endpoints into your application!

      > NOTE: You will have to add libraries to your `pyproject.toml` with `uv add`. You could also bring in a previous environment.

# Ship 🚢

The completed notebook and your RAG app/notebook!

<details>
<summary>🚧 Advanced Build 🚧 (OPTIONAL - <i>open this section for the requirements</i>)</summary>

Use RAGAS to evaluate your open-source powered app against an OpenAI `gpt-4.1-mini` powered Agentic RAG app.

# Submitting You Homework [OPTIONAL]

## Main Homework Assignment

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework assignment:
1. Create a branch of your `AIE8` repo to track your changes. Example command: `git switch -c s17-assignment`
2. Follow the instructions in `ENDPOINT_SETUP.md` 
> _**NOTE: Make sure you select an Auto-shutdown!**_
3. Replace both `model` values in `endpoint_slammer.ipynb` with the `gpt-oss` endpoint you created in Step 2 
4. Run the code cells in `endpoint_slammer.ipynb`
5. Respond to the question at the end of the `ENDPOINT_SETUP.md`
6. Build a sample RAG
7. Commit, and push your changes to your `origin` repository. _NOTE: Do not merge them into your main branch_
8. Record a Loom video reviewing what you have learned from this session
9. Make sure to include all of the following on your Homework Submission Form:
    + The GitHub URL to the `17_Deploying_Open_Source_Endpoints` folder _on your assignment branch (not main)_
    + The URL to your Loom Video
    + Your Three Lessons Learned/Not Yet Learned
    + The URLs to any social media posts (LinkedIn, X, Discord, etc.) ⬅️ _easy Extra Credit points!_
