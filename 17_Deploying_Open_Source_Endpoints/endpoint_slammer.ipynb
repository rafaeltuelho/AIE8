      "A classic tongue‑twister has none of the rigour of a physics problem, but if we treat a *wood‑chuck* (aka the North‑American ground squirrel *Marmota monax*) as a normal, healthy adult the figure that most popular‑science accounts quote is:\n",

      "\n",
      "This number comes from the 1988 *American Association of Woodchuck Biologists* report which calculated the chuck‑capacity from measurements of the animal’s skull, jaw mechanics, and the bite force of a squirrel etc. The calculation is roughly:\n",
